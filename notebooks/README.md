# Notebooks

This folder contains various notebooks demonstrating the features of the Blending ToolKit.

We advise you to follow the notebooks by order of difficulty :
- the intro notebook contains a general introduction to BTK and demonstrates most of the features
- the cosmos, and scarlet notebooks showcase some specific uses of BTK, for generating images using galaxies from the COSMOS dataset and for making measurements with [SCARLET](https://github.com/pmelchior/scarlet) respectively.
- the multi and custom tutorials introduce advanced features of BTK, including how to customize various parts of BTK for your needs.

**NOTE:** Some of the interactive features in the notebooks work only in standard jupyter notebooks and not in jupyterlab.
