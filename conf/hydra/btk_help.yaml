  Welcome to the Command-Line Interface (CLI) for ${hydra.help.app_name}!
  The CLI is designed to run BTK from start to end, starting by creating a 
  DrawBlendGenerator, followed by a MeasureGenerator, and finally calculating
  and saving the corresponding metrics.

  Assuming that BTK has been pip installed, you can run btk from the command line like: 

  btk sampling=default draw_blends=catsim max_number=3 save_path=/path/to/save/results cpus=1
    verbose=False 

  You can choose a db driver by appending
  == Configuration groups ==
  Compose your configuration from those groups (db=mysql)
  $APP_CONFIG_GROUPS
  == Config ==
  This is the config generated for this run.
  You can override everything, for example:
  python my_app.py db.user=foo db.pass=bar
