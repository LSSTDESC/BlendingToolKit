  ${hydra.help.header}
  Welcome to the Command-Line Interface (CLI) for ${hydra.help.app_name}!
  The CLI is designed to run BTK from start to end, starting by creating a
  DrawBlendGenerator, followed by a MeasureGenerator, and finally calculating
  and saving the corresponding metrics via a MetricsGenerator.

  Assuming that BTK has been pip installed, you can run btk from the command line like e.g.

  btk sampling=default draw_blends=catsim max_number=3 save_path=/directory/to/save/results cpus=1
    verbose=False surveys=[Rubin, HST] surveys.Rubin.airmass=1.1
    sampling=random catalog.name=catsim use_metrics=['detection', 'segmentation'] (...)

  You need to create the directory to save results yourself (preferably an empty directory) and specify its absolute path when you run the CLI via the `save_path` parameter.

  == Available Options ==
  Here are all the available options for the CLI.

  * sampling: Specify the sampling function to be used, options:
      {default, galsim_hub, group_sampling, group_sampling_numbered}

  * catalog: Attribute group consisting of two sub-attributes.
      * catalog.name: Name of the BTK catalog class, options: {catsim, cosmos}
      * catalog.catalog_files: Path to files containing catalog information. The 'catsim'
          catalog requires one path, while the `cosmos` type requires two paths specified as
          a list. (see documentation for more details).

    * surveys: Name of the survey(s) you want to use, options are
      {Rubin, HST, HSC, DES, CFHT, Euclid} and correspond to each of the config files available
      in conf/surveys. You can pass in a list of surveys for multi-resolution
      studies too. For example:

      btk surveys=[Rubin, HST] (...)

      Assuming that you want to use e.g. the Rubin survey default parameters but with a couple
      of changes, you can modify individual parameters of a given survey directly from the
      command line:

      btk surveys=Rubin surveys.Rubin.airmass=1.1 (...)

      If you want to modify a large number of parameters of a given survey, it might be easier to
      add your own config file to conf/surveys. See the CLI section of the tutorial for
      more details.

    * draw_blends: Which draw_blend_generator to use, options are {catsim, cosmos, galsim_hub}

    * save_path: Absolute path to a (preferably) empty directory where you would like to save
      results of running BTK.

    * cpus: Number of cpus you would like to use for multiprocessing.

    * verbose: Whether you would like BTK to print

    * batch_size: Size of the batches produced by the various BTK generators.

    * stamp_size: Stamp size of images in arcseconds.

    * max_shift: Maximum shift of galaxies from the center of each postage stamp in arcseconds.

    * add_noise: Whether to add (Poisson) noise to the images.

    * channels_last: Whether to use have images in channel last format (True) or not (False).

    * galsim_hub: Attribute group consisting of options:
        * model: Which galsim_hub model to use (default: 'hub:Lanusse2020')
        * param_names: list of the parameters with which the generation is parametrized; this
          is unique to each model (default: `['flux_radious, 'mag_auto', 'zphot']`).

        NOTE: This flag is only used when `draw_blends=galsim_hub`

    * measure_kwargs: Dictionary or list of dictionaries containing the keyword arguments to be
        passed in to each measure_function.

    * measure_functions: List of measure_functions to be ran, options {'basic', 'sep'}.

    * use_metrics: List of metrics to return, options are:
      {'detection', 'segmentation', 'reconstruction'}

    * meas_band_num: Band index to perform measurements in.

    * noise_threshold_factor: Factor for determining the threshold which is applied when
      getting segmentations from true images. A value of 3 would correspond to a threshold of
      3 sigmas (with sigma the standard deviation of the noise)

    * distance_threshold_match: Maximum distance for matching a detected and a
      true galaxy in pixels (default: 5.0).
