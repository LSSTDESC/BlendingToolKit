Input Catalog
===============

*BlendingToolKit* (btk) requires an input catalog that contains information required to simulate galaxies and blends. Each galaxy is parameterized as a bulge + disk  + agn with parameters following the `LSST DM catalog schema <https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/SIM/Database+Schema>`_

The package includes a sample input catalog that contains parameters of 100 galaxies. A more extensive catalog can be downloaded from `here <https://stanford.box.com/s/s1nzjlinejpqandudjyykjejyxtgylbk>`_.
