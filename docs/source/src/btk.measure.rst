btk.measure module
======================
The measure module defines the :class:`~btk.measure.MeasureGenerator` class, which is used for generating measurements on blends generated on the fly, using a :class:`~btk.measure.MeasurementParams`-like object to define how the measurements are done ; users are expected to create their own class based on :class:`~btk.measure.Measurement_params` to make measurements with their own algorithms. Some examples are provided in the :module:`btk.utils` module.
