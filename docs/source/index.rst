*BlendingToolKit*
===============================
*BlendingToolKit* (BTK) is a framework to generate images of blended objects and evaluate performance metrics on various detection, deblending and measurement algorithms.

Detecting and separating overlapping sources, or "deblending", is primarily a research problem with several potential algorithmic solutions, including machine learning approaches. Computation of performance metrics on identical datasets will enable comparison between different algorithms. The goals of the BTK framework are to allow the user to easily and quickly generate datasets of blended objects for testing different detection, deblending and measurement algorithms, as well as training samples for machine learning algorithms.
