"""File containing measurement infrastructure for the BlendingToolKit.

Contains examples of functions that can be used to apply a measurement algorithm to the blends
simulated by BTK. Every measurement function should have the following skeleton:

::

    def measure_function(batch, idx, **kwargs):
        # do some measurements on the images contained in batch.
        return output


where `batch` is the output from the `DrawBlendsGenerator` object (see its `__next__` method) and
`idx` is the index corresponding to which image in the batch to measure. The additional keyword
arguments `**kwargs` can be passed via the `measure_kwargs` dictionary argument in the
`MeasureGenerator` initialize which are shared among all the measurement functions.

It should return a dictionary containing a subset of the following keys/values (note the key
catalog` is mandatory):

* catalog (astropy.table.Table): An astropy table containing measurement information. The
  `len` of the table should be `n_objects`. If your
  DrawBlendsGenerator uses a single survey, the following
  column names are required:

  * x_peak: horizontal centroid position in pixels.
  * y_peak: vertical centroid position in pixels.

  For multiple surveys (multi-resolution), we instead require:

  * ra: object centroid right ascension in arcseconds,
    following the convention from the `wcs` object included in
    the input batch.
  * dec: vertical centroid position in arcseconds,
    following the convention from the `wcs` object included in
    the input batch.

* deblended_image (np.ndarray): Array of deblended isolated images with shape:
  `(n_objects, n_bands, stamp_size, stamp_size)` or
  `(n_objects, stamp_size, stamp_size, n_bands)` depending on
  convention. The order of this array should correspond to the
  order in the returned `catalog`. Where `n_objects` is the
  number of detected objects by the algorithm. If you are using the multiresolution feature,
  you should instead return a dictionary with a key for each survey containing the
  aforementioned array.

* segmentation (np.ndarray): Array of booleans with shape `(n_objects,stamp_size,stamp_size)`
  The pixels set to True in the i-th channel correspond to the i-th
  object. The order should correspond to the order in the returned
  `catalog`. If you are using the multiresolution feature,
  you should instead return a dictionary with a key for each survey containing the
  aforementioned array.

Omitted keys in the returned dictionary are automatically assigned a `None` value (except for
`catalog` which is a mandatory entry).
